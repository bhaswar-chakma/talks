## A Moment in History: Man vs. Machine

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/kasparov.avif" width="600">
</div>

- In 1997, world champion Garry Kasparov lost to IBM's Deep Blue.



## From Adversaries to Allies

- After losing, Kasparov didn’t give up — he adapted.

- He introduced “centaur chess”, pairing human intuition with machine power.


## From Chess to Finance

Kasparov's idea of man + machine wasn't just for chess.

This study brings that question into finance:  

  - Can human analysts and AI models compete — or collaborate — in forecasting the market?

  - To explore this, the authors created an AI analyst and compared it to real professionals.








## Meet the Analysts

## The Prediction Setup

In this study, both human and AI analysts forecast 12-month-ahead stock returns using target prices.

- Target prices reflect analysts' valuation beliefs  
- Predicted return = (Target – Current Price) / Current Price

- Target prices are preferred over earnings forecasts:
  - Reflect longer-term firm value
  - Less affected by short-term managerial manipulation



## Research Questions

This study addresses three core questions:

1. Can an AI analyst predict 12-month-ahead stock returns more accurately than human analysts?

2. When do human analysts outperform AI — and why?

3. Does combining AI and human forecasts improve accuracy and reduce large errors?

## Methodology: Overview

- The authors construct an AI analyst using machine learning
- The model forecasts 12-month-ahead stock returns derived from target prices
- Each forecast is based on a rolling 3-year window of past data, simulating real-time prediction
- Human forecasts are not used as inputs — predictions are made entirely from public information

## Methodology: Modeling Approach

The AI analyst uses an ensemble of machine learning models:

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks — capture sequential patterns in financial time series
- Random forest — robust to noise and effective with many predictors
- Gradient boosting — excels at handling non-linear relationships and variable interactions

- The ensemble integrates strengths of each model to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.


## The Data: Sample Overview

- **Data sources:**
  - I/B/E/S, Compustat, CRSP (structured data)
  - RavenPack (news sentiment), Twitter (social media)
  - SEC EDGAR (filings), Kogan et al. (patents)

- Over 1.15 million target price forecasts, covering thousands of U.S. firms

- Coverage spans all major sectors, firm sizes, and time periods (2001–2018)


## The Data: AI Analyst Input Overview

The AI analyst is trained on a wide variety of publicly available information.

- Human analyst data: I/B/E/S target prices (2001–2018)
- AI model: trained on 3 years of historical data prior to each forecast
- Forecast target: 12-month stock return based on target price

## The Data: Categories of inputs

The model draws from six key categories of inputs:

```{mermaid}
graph TD
  A[AI Analyst Inputs] --> B[Firm Data]
  A --> C[Industry Data]
  A --> D[Macro Data]
  A --> E[Filings]
  A --> F[Sentiment]
  A --> G[Innovation]
```



## The Data: Structured Inputs

**Firm Data:**
- Size, book-to-market, ROA
- Leverage, accruals
- Past returns (1–36 months), volatility
- Amihud illiquidity

**Industry Data:**
- Fama-French industry groupings
- Industry competition (text-based)
- Product market fluidity

**Macro Data:**
- GDP growth, CPI, oil prices
- Treasury yields, credit spreads
- Market-level illiquidity


## The Data: Textual and Alternative Inputs

**Filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K):**
- Sentiment and tone (Loughran–McDonald)
- Readability and complexity
- Text similarity and novelty

**Sentiment:**
- RavenPack news sentiment
- Twitter-based firm sentiment (Cao et al. 2021a)

**Innovation:**
- Patent value estimates (Kogan et al. 2017)



## Results: Performance – AI vs. Human

AI uses only public data, with no access to analyst forecasts or private information.

- The AI analyst outperforms human analysts in approximately 54.5% of stock forecasts.
  - This outperformance is consistent across time, sectors, and market conditions.

## Results: What Drives the AI Analyst?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Create the data frame with correct values from Figure 2
df <- data.frame(
  Category = c(
    "Macroeconomic variables",
    "Firm return history and prices",
    "Firm characteristics",
    "Industry variables",
    "Textual variables",
    "Earnings (firm and industry)"
  ),
  Contribution = c(27.6, 24.4, 22.0, 14.7, 9.3, 2.0),
  Type = c("Structured", "Structured", "Structured", 
           "Structured", "Unstructured/Alternative", "Structured")
)

# Sort by descending contribution
df <- df %>%
  arrange(desc(Contribution))

# Create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = reorder(Category, Contribution), y = Contribution, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Contribution, "%")), 
            hjust = -0.1, size = 4.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Structured" = "steelblue", "Unstructured/Alternative" = "darkorange")) +
  labs(
    title = "Contribution of groups of variables to the AI prediction: take-one-out approach.",
    x = "",
    y = "Contribution (%)",
    fill = "Input Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(5.5, 40, 5.5, 5.5, "pt")) +
  ylim(0, 35)

```


## Results: When Humans Outperform AI

While the AI model performs better overall, human analysts outperform in specific contexts:

- Firms with high intangible assets (e.g. R&D, brand value)
- Firms facing financial distress or complex restructuring
- Stocks with low liquidity or limited trading activity
- Situations requiring qualitative judgment or soft information


## Results: Man + Machine – The Hybrid Model

Combining AI forecasts with analyst predictions and profiles creates a hybrid “centaur” analyst.

- The hybrid model slightly outperforms standalone AI in forecast accuracy.
- It improves consistency and reduces large forecast errors.
- Man + Machine captures the strengths of both:
  - AI’s scale and objectivity
  - Human analysts’ intuition and contextual judgment


## The Hybrid Model Avoids Extreme Errors

- Extreme errors = forecasts in the top 10% of squared prediction errors

- Man + Machine avoids:
  - 90.7% of extreme errors made by human analysts
  - 43.6% of extreme errors made by the AI model

## Conclusion

1. Can AI outperform human analysts?
   - Yes, AI beats the best human analyst in ~54.5% of cases using only public data.

2. When do human analysts outperform AI?
   - In complex settings like illiquidity, distress, and high intangibles — where qualitative judgment matters.

3. Can combining AI and human forecasts improve results?
   - Yes, the hybrid model slightly improves accuracy and greatly reduces extreme forecasting errors.
