## A Moment in History: Man vs. Machine

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/kasparov.avif" width="600">
</div>

- In 1997, world champion Garry Kasparov lost to IBM's Deep Blue.



## From Adversaries to Allies

- After losing, Kasparov didn’t give up — he adapted.

- He introduced “centaur chess”, pairing human intuition with machine power.


## From Chess to Finance

Kasparov's idea of man + machine wasn't just for chess.

This study brings that question into finance:  

  - Can human analysts and AI models compete — or collaborate — in forecasting the market?

  - To explore this, the authors created an AI analyst and compared it to real professionals.








## Meet the Analysts

- Uses intuition and experience  
- Reads disclosures, meets firms  
- Prone to cognitive or incentive bias

## The Prediction Setup

In this study, both human and AI analysts forecast 12-month-ahead stock returns using target prices.

- Target prices reflect analysts' valuation beliefs  
- Predicted return = (Target – Current Price) / Current Price

::: {.incremental}
- Target prices are preferred over earnings forecasts:
  - They capture longer-term firm value
  - Earnings forecasts are often influenced by managerial efforts to meet expectations

## Research Questions

This study addresses three core questions:

1. Can an AI analyst predict 12-month-ahead stock returns more accurately than human analysts?

2. When do human analysts outperform AI — and why?

3. Does combining AI and human forecasts improve accuracy and reduce large errors?

## Methodology: Overview

- The authors construct an AI analyst using machine learning
- The model forecasts 12-month-ahead stock returns derived from target prices
- Each forecast is based on a rolling 3-year window of past data, simulating real-time prediction
- Human forecasts are not used as inputs — predictions are made entirely from public information

## Methodology: Modeling Approach

The AI analyst uses an ensemble of machine learning models:

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks — capture sequential patterns in financial time series
- Random forest — robust to noise and effective with many predictors
- Gradient boosting — excels at handling non-linear relationships and variable interactions

- The ensemble leverages the strengths of each model type to improve predictive accuracy.



## The Data: AI Analyst Input Overview

The AI analyst is trained on a wide variety of publicly available information.

- Human analyst data: I/B/E/S target prices (2001–2018)
- AI model: trained on 3 years of historical data prior to each forecast
- Forecast target: 12-month stock return based on target price

## The Data: Categories of inputs
The model draws from six key categories of inputs:

  A --> C[Industry Data]
  A --> D[Macro Data]
  A --> E[Filings]
  A --> F[Sentiment]

```

Structure:

- Structured Inputs

- Textual and Alternative Inputs


## The Data: Structured Inputs

**Firm Data:**
- Size, book-to-market, ROA
- Leverage, accruals
- Past returns (1–36 months), volatility
- Amihud illiquidity

**Industry Data:**
- Fama-French industry groupings
- Industry competition (text-based)
- Product market fluidity

**Macro Data:**
- GDP growth, CPI, oil prices
- Treasury yields, credit spreads
- Market-level illiquidity


## The Data: Textual and Alternative Inputs

**Filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K):**
- Sentiment and tone (Loughran–McDonald)
- Readability and complexity
- Text similarity and novelty

**Sentiment:**
- RavenPack news sentiment
- Twitter-based firm sentiment (Cao et al. 2021a)

**Innovation:**
- Patent value estimates (Kogan et al. 2017)

## Results: Performance – AI vs. Human

AI uses only public data, with no access to analyst forecasts or private information.

- The AI analyst outperforms human analysts in approximately 54.5% of stock forecasts.
  - This outperformance is consistent across time, sectors, and market conditions.

## Results: When Humans Outperform AI

While the AI model performs better overall, human analysts outperform in specific contexts:

- Firms with high intangible assets (e.g. R&D, brand value)
- Firms facing financial distress or complex restructuring
- Stocks with low liquidity or limited trading activity
- Situations requiring qualitative judgment or soft information


## Results: Man + Machine – The Hybrid Model

Combining AI forecasts with human analyst inputs creates a hybrid “centaur” analyst.

- The hybrid model slightly outperforms standalone AI in forecast accuracy.
- It improves consistency and reduces large forecast errors.
- Man + Machine captures the strengths of both:
  - AI’s scale and objectivity
  - Human analysts’ intuition and contextual judgment


## The Hybrid Model Avoids Extreme Errors

- Extreme errors = forecasts in the top 10% of squared prediction errors

- Man + Machine avoids:
  - 90.7% of extreme errors made by human analysts
  - 43.6% of extreme errors made by the AI model

## Conclusion

1. Can AI outperform human analysts?
   - Yes, AI beats the best human analyst in ~54.5% of cases using only public data.

2. When do human analysts outperform AI?
   - In complex settings like illiquidity, distress, and high intangibles — where qualitative judgment matters.

3. Can combining AI and human forecasts improve results?
   - Yes, the hybrid model slightly improves accuracy and greatly reduces extreme forecasting errors.
