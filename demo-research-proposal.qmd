- In 2018, The Economist named her one of the decade’s eight best young economists.

- In  2014 she was named by the IMF as the youngest of 25 economists under the age of 45 shaping thought about the global economy.

## What is ESG and Why It Matters

- **E**: Environmental — climate risk, emissions, energy use  
- **S**: Social — labor rights, diversity, community impact  
- **G**: Governance — board structure, executive compensation, ethics  
- ESG evaluates non-financial risk and ethical standards  
- Relevance: ESG data is unstructured and strategic → ideal for ML and causal inference

## Overview

Three empirical papers on ESG and financial markets:

1. **ESG Disclosure and Price Informativeness**  
   → Do disclosures improve market efficiency?

2. **ESG in Asset Pricing with Deep Learning**  
   → Do ESG features improve stock return forecasts?

3. **Institutional ESG Consistency**  
   → Do institutions align ESG rhetoric with their actions?

All papers combine machine learning and causal inference with financial and text data.

## Paper 1 – Goals and Motivation

**Main Goal:**  
To examine whether ESG disclosures improve the efficiency of financial markets.

**Key Questions:**  
- Do ESG disclosures lead to lower return volatility?  
- Do they reduce bid-ask spreads?  
- Do they accelerate price discovery?

**Why It Matters:**  
- ESG reporting is increasing but varies in quality.  
- Prior studies focus on the presence of disclosure, not the content.  
- Investors and regulators need to know what kind of ESG reporting actually informs markets.

## Paper 1 – What I Will Do

- Collect ESG disclosure text from 10-Ks and sustainability reports  
- Use BERT/RoBERTa to extract:  
  - Sentiment, specificity, readability, topical focus  
- Apply contrastive learning to detect boilerplate vs meaningful content  
- Estimate market effects: volatility, spreads, price delay  
- Identify causal effects using IV (e.g., regulatory changes)  
- Combine ML with inference using prediction-powered methods
:::

## Paper 1 – Expected Results

**Expected Results:**  
- Forward-looking, specific ESG disclosures will reduce:

  - Return volatility  
  - Bid-ask spreads  
  - Price delay

**Why?**  
- **Christensen, Serafeim, & Sikochi (2022):**  
  High-quality ESG disclosures improve liquidity and transparency.  
  → Content quality, not just disclosure presence, drives outcomes.

## Paper 1 – My Contribution

- Apply transformer NLP (BERT) to ESG reporting content  
- Use contrastive learning to evaluate substance vs boilerplate  
- Estimate causal effects using IV and prediction-powered inference [Zrnic and Candès (2023)]
- Advance ESG market microstructure research using text-based methods

## Paper 2 – Goals and Motivation

**Main Goal:**  
To test whether ESG features improve stock return prediction in a machine learning framework.

**Key Questions:**  
- Can ESG data improve asset pricing models?  
- Are ESG-informed portfolios more profitable and stable?

**Why It Matters:**  
- Traditional models (e.g., Fama-French) assume linearity.  
- ESG data is high-dimensional, likely nonlinear, and underused.  
- ML has improved pricing models (Gu et al., 2020) but rarely includes ESG.

## Paper 2 – What I Will Do

- Build firm-month panel: returns, fundamentals, ESG (CRSP, Compustat, Bloomberg, LSEG)  
- Apply ML models: Lasso, XGBoost, Neural Networks  
- Add ESG features: emissions, board diversity, controversies  
- Evaluate model performance: out-of-sample R², Sharpe ratio, turnover  
- Interpret models using SHAP values and PDPs
:::



::: {.slide style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
## Paper 2 – Expected Results

**Expected Results:**  
- ESG features will enhance predictive power  
- ESG-augmented models will yield:  
  - Higher Sharpe ratios  
  - Better R²  
  - Lower turnover

**Why?**  
- **Gu, Kelly, & Xiu (2020):**  
  ML models outperform linear ones in return prediction.  
  → Adding ESG may reveal alpha related to risk or preferences.

## Paper 2 – My Contribution

- First study integrating ESG into full ML asset pricing pipeline  
- Demonstrates ESG alpha using interpretable ML  
- Bridges predictive power and economic interpretation  
- Offers practical tools for investors managing ESG portfolios

## Paper 3 – Goals and Motivation

**Main Goal:**  
To assess whether institutional investors align ESG claims with their real behavior.

**Key Questions:**  
- Do ESG statements match actual voting and portfolio decisions?  
- Do inconsistencies affect investor flows?

**Why It Matters:**  
- ESG credibility is under fire — greenwashing is a top concern  
- No scalable method exists to measure ESG consistency  
- Investor trust depends on aligning talk and action
:::



::: {.slide style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
## Paper 3 – What I Will Do

- Collect ESG policy statements, proxy votes (N-PX), and holdings (13F)  
- Apply transformer NLP to extract ESG pledges by theme  
- Link actions to claims using LinkTransformer + HDBSCAN  
- Build ESG Consistency Index  
- Use DiD regressions to test effect on fund flows (CRSP)
:::



::: {.slide style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
## Paper 3 – Expected Results

**Expected Results:**  
- Many funds will show inconsistencies across statements, votes, and holdings  
- Inconsistent funds will lose capital from ESG-conscious investors

**Why?**  
- **Raghunandan & Rajgopal (2022):**  
  ESG-branded funds often vote against ESG proposals.  
  → This disconnect signals symbolic rather than substantive commitment.
:::



::: {.slide style="font-size: 0.7em;"}
## Paper 3 – My Contribution

- Create the first scalable ESG Consistency Index  
- Use NLP + record linkage + clustering to evaluate ESG behavior  
- Quantify the financial consequences of ESG inconsistency  
- Help investors and regulators hold ESG funds accountable
